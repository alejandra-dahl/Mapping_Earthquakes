# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

In this project, an interactive map was built to show earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates and magnitude. The map has several ways to be viewed - street, satellite, dark. Tectonic plates are shown in red and level of magnitude is show with darkening circles. The blue circles represent earthquakes with the most impact/magnitude.


Javascript's leaflet and d3 libraries, mapbox's api, and geoJson was used.
